# Mobile App Security

Keyri SDKs are embedded with a suite of security checks as outlined below. These
are best in class standalone features that can be utilized when Keyri methods
are called or be implemented throughout your mobile application for protection
against code tampering, runtime manipulation, and reverse engineering.

- Emulator detection
- Jailbreak detection
- Method swizzle detection
- Presence of known malicious apps and packages on the device
- Code tamper detection
- Runtime injection detection

## Usage

Keyri automatically runs application security checks upon the instantiation of
the Keyri object built into our SDKs. Simply calling the Keyri constructor will
trigger each of the checks. The SDK is configured to terminate the application
if any of these checks fail, as the entire runtime environment and all of the
data within your application can potentially be compromised in such a situation.

Please be sure to install Keyri mobile SDKs as outlined in our documentation:
[SDK installation and initialization](./mobile-sdks/installation)

### Enabling Emulator Detection

The SDK constructor has `blockEmulatorDetection` set to `true` by default. This
is to allow for local development of your application on an emulator without the
SDK terminating the application. If you would like to deny the running of your
application on emulators, set this parameter to `false` when you want to deploy
your app for production use.
