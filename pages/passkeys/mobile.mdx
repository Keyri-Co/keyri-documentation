# Mobile Passkeys

This is what shows up on the user's phone's browser after they scan a QR code.

## Mobile HTML

```html
<script type="module">
  import { ApplessMobile } = "keyri-auth-core";

  //
  // App Key will only work in dev environments.
  // In production, it will make your app fail
  //
  const mobileAppless = new ApplessMobile(
    "dev",
    "IT7VrTQ0r4InzsvCNJpRCRpi1qzfgpaj"
  );

  //
  // This makes a request to the Keyri API to get the data 
  // for the QR Code that was scanned.
  //
  // n.b. `mobileData` has an object called "template" which tells you everything
  // the API has decided about the request.
  //
  const mobileData = await mobileAppless.start();

  if (mobileData.userParameters?.register === "true") {
    //
    // If you made the user put in a PIN on the desktop, make them
    // enter the same PIN here
    //
    let ONE_TIME_PIN = prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 100");
    
    //
    let output = await mobileAppless.finish(ONE_TIME_PIN);
  } else {
    let output = await mobileAppless.finish();
  }
</script>
