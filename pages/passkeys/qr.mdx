# QR Passkeys

This allows you to put a passkey on your phone, and later scan other devices to login - without having to install an App.

## Desktop Validation

Nothing! If you are set up for local passkeys a registered phone just has to scan the QR.

## Desktop Registration

```js
//
// This generates a url for the iframe.
// YOU have to set the `src` of the iframe.
//
async function makeMobilePassKey(e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Since the user is already logged in, we send something to prove that a logged in user is initiating this request
  const SESSION_TOKEN = "{SESSION_TOKEN}";

  // This is the iframe the user will scan to register their phone
  const QR_IFRAME = document.getElementById("qr-iframe");

  // We get random input from the user to prove they control both the DESKTOP and PHONE.
  const ONE_TIME_PIN = prompt("Pick a number between 1 and 100");

  // Get the querystring we need to set for the iframe
  let QUERY_STRING = localAppless.registerMobile(SESSION_TOKEN, ONE_TIME_PIN);

  // Finally, set the src of the iframe.
  let TMP_SRC = `./qr.html?mobile=http://localhost/mobile.html&qsd=false&Environment=dev&Origin=misc.keyri.com&${QUERY_STRING}`;
  QR_IFRAME.src = TMP_SRC;
}
```
