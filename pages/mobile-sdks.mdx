# Mobile SDKs

## Authentication

Keyri's mobile SDKs handle the secure cryptographic key generation, key storage,
encryption, API communications, desktop session identification, and QR scanning
required for passwordless authentication in your mobile apps and "sign in with
QR" capabilities on your web and smart TV apps.

The SDKs include pre-built QR authentication UIs that you can use to finish the
mobile side of the system quickly. This pre-built UI can be customized to match
your app's aesthetic. Alternatively, you can call the SDK's lower-level
functions to build your own entirely custom QR authentication UI/UX.

Our SDKs and API allow your customers to scan your QR code from anywhere - from
within your app or with their phone's built-in camera app. The latter case is
handled by App Links \(Android\) and Universal Links \(iOS\). The mobile SDK
documentation here will walk you through how to set this up.

Keyri's mobile SDKs allow you to send custom data from your app to any client
showing the Keyri QR widget, with end-to-end encryption, allowing you to build
features that go beyond QR authentication functionality.

## Device Fingerprinting

Keyri's mobile SDKs handle the identification of relevant mobile parameters,
secure cryptographic key generation, key storage, encryption, and API
communications required to create a persistent mobile device fingerprint to
track and identify your customers' mobile devices.
