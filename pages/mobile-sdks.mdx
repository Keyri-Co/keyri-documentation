# Mobile SDKs

Keyri's mobile SDKs are required for
[cryptographic passwordless authentication](/passwordless-authentication/mobile-app-authentication),
[QR authentication](/passwordless-authentication/qr-authentication), and
[fraud prevention](/fraud-prevention/) in native mobile apps. The SDKs are NOT
required for
[email magic links](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/email-magic-link),
[reverse SMS](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/reverse-sms),
[passkeys](/passwordless-authentication/passkeys), or fraud prevention
[in web apps](/fraud-prevention/web-app-setup).

The SDKs additionally provide built-in app security features, such as root,
malicious app, tampering, and other detection capabilities. This detection runs
upon SDK initialization and results in the app shutting down before it is
compromised any further.

SDKs are available for iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and Cordova. Read on
for installation and initialization instructions.
