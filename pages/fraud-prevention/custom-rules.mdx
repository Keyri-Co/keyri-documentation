# Custom Rules Guide and Conditions Enumeration

Keyri enables the creation of custom fraud prevention rules for customers on our
Fraud Prevention Scaling and Enterprise plans. These rules can be created and
edited in the Keyri dashboard using either our no-code rule builder or
[low-code rule builder](/fraud-prevention/custom-rules/low-code-rule-builder).
For examples of useful custom rules, please see our
[examples](/fraud-prevention/custom-rules/custom-rules-cookbook).

Rules are built using a combination of conditions, comparators, values,
outcomes, and strengths.

- **Conditions** are the data points that are used to evaluate the rule â€” a
  combination of data points that Keyri collects from the user's device and
  calculates.
- **Comparators** are the operators that are used to compare the condition to
  the value.
- **Values** are the values that are used to compare the condition to.
- **Outcomes** are the recommendation of the rule that results from the
  evaluation of the rule to be used by your server to determine the course of
  action to take for the user's request. For example, you can use our standard
  "allow", "warn", and "deny" outcomes, or you can create your own custom
  outcomes in the low-code rule builder.
- **Strengths** are the weights that are assigned to the rule to determine
  whether this rule gets overridden by other rules or overrides other rules. The
  higher the strength number, the more likely the rule is to override other
  rules. Strengths can only be assigned in the low-code rule builder.

A full list of conditions is as follows:

## Available Conditions

### Condition Categories

The following are high-level categories of conditions that can be used to build
rules. The next section details the specific conditions that are available
within each category. When building a rule, you must use dot notation to specify
the condition that you want to use. For example, if you want to use the user's
user agent as a condition, you would use `deviceModel.userAgentParsed`.

- `eventType`: Identifies the type of event being evaluated.
- `eventMetadata`: An optional field for logging additional event details. This
  is provided to Keyri from your application at the time that you trigger the
  creation of an event.
- `userId`: The provided ID of the user.
- [`timeData`](#timedata): Breakdown of the current time (year, month, hour,
  etc.) useful in setting rules based on usual operating hours.
- [`ipData`](#ipdata): Contains the IP address and associated ISP data.
- [`ipGeoData`](#ipgeodata): Geographical data derived from the IP address.
- [`threat`](#threat): Data related to IP-based threats and other anomalies
  (e.g., improbable travel speed, timezone mismatches).
- `eventLimitCounter`: Count of the number of API requests in 10 seconds
- [`deviceModel`](#devicemodel): Information about the device, including its
  history and user associations.
- [`historicalData`](#historicaldata): Offers insights into user, device, and
  IP-based activities and trends.
- `instanceDeltas`: If the current event has some attribute that's never been
  seen before, it'll show up here. For example, the first time the user shows up
  in a new country, or with a new operating system - it will be identified here.
- [`changeHistory`](#changehistory): Tracks changes in user or device attributes
  over specified time intervals.
- `uuid`: The unique identifier for the event, useful for auditing and analysis.
- `state`: The result of the rules evaluation (e.g., 'allow', 'warn', 'deny').
- `signals`: Array populated with 'signals' whenever a rule is triggered.
- [`userModel`](#usermodel): Aggregates data associated with the user over time.
- `points`: (Currently unavailable) Assigned to rules and aggregated when
  triggered.

### Conditions

#### `timeData`

- **Purpose**: Facilitates rule creation based on current date and time, both
  globally (UTC) and locally (IP-based timezone).

- **Use Case**: Say you want to set a rule where nobody is allowed to access
  your site between the hours of 1 and 5 in the morning, or make a transaction
  on Saturday, their time. The following will allow you do create such rules.

* `localYear`: Four digit year where the client is located.
* `localMonth`: Two digit month where the client is located.
* `localDayOfMonth`:Two digit day of the month where the client is located.
* `localDayOfWeek`: Two digit day of the week where the client is located.
  Sunday is 0, Saturday is 6.
* `localHour`: Hour of the day where the client is located on a 24 hour clock.
* `globalYear`: Four digit year UTC.
* `globalMonth`: Two digit month UTC.
* `globalDayOfMonth`: Two digit day of the month UTC.
* `globalDayOfWeek`: Two digit day of week UTC.
* `globalHour`: Current hour of the day, UTC.
* `globalMinute`: Current minute of the day.
* `globalSecond`: Current second of the day.

#### `ipData`

- **Purpose**: Provides basic IP information.

- **Use Case**: Useful in identifying and acting on suspicious IP addresses or
  ISPs.

* `ip`: The IP Address of the Current Event
* `asn_name`: Name of the ISP
* `asn_route`: CIDR block and Subnet mask containing the user's IP Address.

#### `ipGeoData`

* `continent_code`: Two letter continent code of the IP Address
* `country_code`: Two digit country code of the IP Address
* `ip_timezone_name`: IANA timezone database format ("America/Los_Angeles") of
  the timezone of the IP Address
* `latitude`: Latitude of the IP Address
* `longitude`: Longitude of the IP Address
* `region_code`: Two Character region / state code

#### `threat`

- **Purpose**: Lists potential threats and their statuses.

- **Use Case**: Essential for blocking access based on various threat
  indicators.

* `is_tor`: is true if the IP address is associated with a node on the Tor
  network
* `is_vpn`: true for VPN IP addresses.
* `is_icloud_relay`: true for IP addresses belonging to Apple's iCloud relay
  service
* `is_proxy`: is true if the IP address is a known proxy, includes
  HTTP/HTTPS/SSL/SOCKS/CONNECT and transparent proxies
* `is_datacenter`: true for any IP addresses that belong to a datacenter
  including all cloud providers. Can be useful for detecting automated/bot
  traffic.
* `is_anonymous`: is set true if either one of is_tor or is_proxy is true
* `is_known_attacker`: is true if an IP address is a known source of malicious
  activity, i.e. attacks, malware, botnet activity etc
* `is_known_abuser`: is true if the IP address is a known source of abuse, i.e.,
  spam, harvesters, registration bots, and other nuisance bots, etc.
* `is_threat`:is true if either one of is_known_abuser or is_known_attacker is
  true
* `is_bogon`: is true if the IP Address is a bogon (A bogon address refers to an
  IP address that is not allocated for use on the public internet, either
  because it is reserved for private networks, special purposes, or simply
  unassigned. These addresses are commonly filtered in network security to
  prevent malicious activities like spoofing, as they should not appear in
  legitimate internet traffic.).
* `ip_blocklists`: is true if the IP Address has been reported to one of several
  "blacklisting" sites
* `is_timezone_inconsistent`: true if the timezone provided by the browser is
  different from the IP Address's timezone. Possible indicator of proxy usage.
  Probable indicator that **something** is up.
* `improbableTravel`: true if the user appears to have moved between two
  locations faster than 1,600kmph (1,000mph) _without_ being related to VPN
  toggling or other internet related artifacts

#### `deviceModel`

- **Purpose**: Collection of information about the device, users that have used
  the device, etc...

- **Use Case**: It contains a lot of information about the device, what IP
  Addresses and users its been associated with, and what those relationships
  look like. Super helpful in assessing the trustworthiness of a device.

* `deviceId`: The unique id of the device
* `deviceAgeLocal`: Number of days ago this deviceId was first seen by **YOUR**
  application.
* `deviceAgeGlobal`: Number of days ago this deviceId was first seen by **OUR**
  application
* `deviceAgeUser`: Number of days ago this userId _and_ deviceId were seen
  together by your application

  accessed from different browsers on the same computer
* `users`: A listing of all userId's that have successfully used the device, and
  the number of times they used it
* `events`: Listing of all events, users, counts ever created by this device.
  For example:

```javascript
// `_usage_` represents the total event count, while `_unique_` indicates the count of unique user IDs

"events": {
    "login": {
        "ivy-mike": 240,
        "leo-tzillard": 1,
        "enrico-fermi": 29,
        "_usage_": 270,
        "_unique_": 3
    },
}
```

- `system`: If Available, the operating system of the device
- `userAgentParsed`: If Available, the name of the user-agent _less_ versioning
  information, etc...
- `language`: Language settings provided by the device
- `lieProbability`: The likelihood that the device has been tampered with to
  look like a different device or have a different fingerprint
- `time_zone_location`: If available, the timezone of the device - in the
  following format: `America, Chicago`

#### `historicalData`

- **Purpose**: Listing by user, device, ip - how many requests, denials, and
  what percentage of denials have occurred in the last 10 minutes, hour, day, or
  ever.

- **Use Case**: If a user has a denial percentage over 50% and has made 30
  requests to login the last hour - this data lets you create a rule to deny
  these transactions

* `device`: Count of events, denials, and denial percentages incurred by _this_
  device
  - `_denials_10_min_`: Number of denials this device has hit in the last 10
    minutes
  - `_denials_hour_`: Number of denials this device has incurred in the last
    hour
  - `_denials_day_`: Number of denials this device has incurred in the last 24
    hours
  - `_denials_all_`: Number of denials this device has ever incurred
  - `_totals_10_min_`: Number of events this device has created in the last 10
    minutes
  - `_totals_hour_`: Number of events this device has created in the last hour
  - `_totals_day_`: Number of events associated with this device in the last 24
    hours
  - `_totals_all_` Number of events associated with this device for all time
  - `_percent_denial_10_min_`: Percent of events denied on this device in the
    last 10 minutes
  - `_percent_denial_hour_`: Percent of events denied on this device in the last
    60 minutes
  - `_percent_denial_day_`: Percent of events denied on this device in the last
    24 hours
  - `_percent_denial_all_`: Percent of events denied on this device for all time
  - `events`: Same information as above, but broken out by 'eventType'
  - `uniqueUser`: Count of unique users using this device in the last 10
    minutes, hour, day, or ever. For both totals and denials. E.G. how many
    users have been denied on this device in the last 24 hours.
  - `uniqueIp`: Count of unique IP Addresses used by this device in the last 10
    minutes, hour, day, or ever. For both totals and denials. E.G. how many IP
    Addresses were used by this device in the last 24 hours? How many were
    denied?
  - `uniqueDevice`: Count of unique Devices used by this device in the last 10
    minutes, hour, day, or ever. For both totals and denials. This isn't
    particularlay useful here since
* `ip`: Count of events, denials, and denial percentages incurred by _this_ IP
  Address - in the same structure and break out as 'device'. This is kind of
  cool since it includes data by **ALL** devices and **ALL** users on _this_ ip
  address.
* `user`: Count of events, denials, and denial percentages incurred by _this_
  user - in the same structure and break out as 'device'

#### `changeHistory`

- **Purpose**: Broken out by `user` and `device` - tells you how many times a
  given attribute (city, state, user-agent, etc) has changed in the last 10
  minutes, hour, 24 hours, and 7 days. **NOTE**: every change from the prior
  instance is counted.

- **Use Case**: If a deviceId changes IP Addresses 15 times in 10 minutes -
  something might be up. You can block it here.

* Attributes: `asn_name`,`city`,`continent_code`, `country_code`,`dayOfWeek`,
  `dayPart`,`deviceId`,`eventType`,`ip`,`ip_timezone_name`, `is_anonymous`,
  `is_datacenter`,`is_proxy`,`is_tor`,`is_vpn`,`language`,`lieProbability`,`longitude`,`latitude`,`region_code`,`state`,`system`,`time_zone_location`,`userAgentParsed`,`wagId`

* Sub-Attributes: All of the attributes listed above have the following
  properties: `changes_last_10_minutes`, `changes_last_hour`,
  `changes_last_24_hours`, `changes_last_7_days`

#### `userModel`

- **Purpose**: Attributes associated with the user's prior sessions.

- **Use Case**: Originally concieved as part of a Bayesian Framework, you can
  gauge how "normal" a user's session is by looking at the frequency of use of
  the current attribute against all attributes over time. e.g. The user's
  current city is "Los Alamos" which was last seen over 80 days ago, and
  represents 0.2% of the user's "City" usage.

* Attributes: `asn_name`,`city`,`continent_code`, `country_code`,`dayOfWeek`,
  `dayPart`,`deviceId`,`eventType`,`ip`,`ip_timezone_name`, `is_anonymous`,
  `is_datacenter`,`is_proxy`,`is_tor`,`is_vpn`,`language`,`lieProbability`,`longitude`,`latitude`,`region_code`,`state`,`system`,`time_zone_location`,`userAgentParsed`,`wagId`

* **Sub-Attributes**: Each attribute has a list of every value ever associated
  with the user, detailed metrics therein, and the following:

* `_count_` : Number of this this attribute has been seen
* `_lastdate_`: The last date this attribute was seen
* `_lastentry_`: The last value for this attribute provided by this user (e.g.
  with `city` it might be "Paris")
* `_maxentry_`: The _largest_ value ever associated with this user for this
  attribute (e.g. for `city` it might be "Zurich")
* `_unique_`: The number of unique entries for an attribute for this user (if
  the user has logged events in 4 differennt cities - the number would be 4)
* `_unique_10_min_`: The number of unique entries for an attribute for this user
  in the last 10 minutes
* `_unique_1_hr_`: The number of unique entries for an attribute for this user
  in the last hour
* `_unique_24_hr_`: The number of unique entries for an attribute for this user
  in the last day
* `_unique_1_month_`: The number of unique entries for an attribute for this
  user in the last month

* **Value-Attributes**: Each entry for an attribute (e.g. "Dallas" under the
  attribute "city") has the following properties:

* `age`: how many days ago was this value first seen for this user
* `counter`: how many times has this value been seen for this user
* `firstdate`: what was the first date this value was seen for this user
* `last_10_minutes`: how many times was this value seen in the last 10 minutes
* `last_hour`: how many times was this value seen for this user in the last hour
* `last_24_hours`: how many times was this value seen for this user in the last
  day
* `last_month`: how many times was this value seen for this user in the last
  month
* `last_used`: how many days ago was this value used
* `lastdate`: when was this value last seen for this user
* `percent`: how many times has this value been used for this attribute for this
  user (e.g. what percent of the time was the user's city "Fort Worth")
