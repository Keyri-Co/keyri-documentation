# Fraud Analytics Server-Side Setup

For analysis and decryption of the object created by the client, you will need
to hit our REST API Server with a payload like described below.

## Node.js Example

If your backend uses a different framework, feel free to reach out to
support@keyri.com for specific code and guidance.

### Server Code

Please bne sure to have read the client-side setup documentation
([web](/fraud-prevention/web-fingerprinting) or
[mobile](/fraud-prevention/mobile-fingerprinting)) before proceeding.

```javascript copy
// Nothing to import.

const url = 'https://fp.keyri.com/v1/client';

// Create Payload
const sendBody = {
  // this comes from the client application
  encryptedB64Payload: 'eyJjbGllbnRFbmNyeX...U4UmVJK09wOHc9PSJ9',
  // the string "undefined" is special. It tells our API to give the user
  // the same "userId" as their "deviceId"
  userId: 'undefined',
  // This can be anything - but "visits","login","signup","access" are common.
  eventType: 'visits',
  // This can be anything you want to use for later analytics or rules
  metadata: { key: 'value' },
  // We need you to give us the IP address of the client
  ipAddress,
  // We need you to give us the headers the client gave you
  headers: event.headers,
  // This is your public encryption key. (app.keyri.com > setup & credentials > Service Encryption Key)
  Service_Encryption_Key,
  // If not provided, you'll have to decrypt the payload yourself
  Service_Decryption_Key,
};

// Send and receive response
let processedData = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(sendBody),
});

let processedDataJson = await processedData.json();
```

### Decrypted Object

- `riskSummary`: Outcome based on your risk settings (e.g., "warn", "allow",
  "deny").

- `ipAddress`: Client's IP address.

- `ipLocationData`: Geographical data derived from IP (city, region, country,
  and time zone)

- `userId`: User ID in your system.

- `deviceId`: Unique device ID.

- `wagId`: Liberal device ID - similar across browsers.

- `signals`: Suspicious signals detected.

- `trustScore`: A score between 0 and 1, based on browser metrics, behavioral
  analytics, and Bayesian machine learning. A higher score indicates a "good"
  user.

- `changes`: Recorded changes to user or device.

- `event_type`: Type of logged event.

- `deviceAge`: Age of the device ID in _your_ service.

- `globalDeviceAge`: Age of the device ID across _any_ service.

- `timestamp`: Time of the API's assessment.

- `clientPublicSignatureKey`: Key for verifying the encrypted object's
  signature.

- `instance`: Data available for rules engine processing.

Example of a typical decrypted response:

```json

    "ipAddress": "6.6.6.6",
    "userId": "Bad@Guy.com",
    "deviceId": "6c6d32ed-50...-c453429b3d5b",
    "wagId": "NFDp7Gg0vv...MMAaDTKWP0=",
    "signals": [
        "multiple_account_signups_per_device",
        "multiple_account_access_per_device"
    ],
    "trustScore": 0.11329117957360035,
    "changes": [],
    "event_type": "signup",
    "deviceAge": 157.31792944444445,
    "globalDeviceAge": 168.628485,
    "timeStamp": 1688905691858,
    "riskSummary": "deny",
    "ipLocationData": {
        "city": "Dallas",
        "region": "Texas",
        "country": "US",

    },
    "instance": {

    }
}
```
