# Web App Fraud Analytics

Keyri provides a JavaScript agent for fraud analytics that produces durable
device ID fingerprints that persist across sessions. It provides risk analytics
data to your client and server for events you want analyzed. Trigger the fraud
analytics agent at each event that you want to assess the risk of; the Keyri API
will provide a summary of the risk level and details about the event's risk
signals as well as details about the user such as location. The JavaScript agent
is lightweight and can be deployed in a few minutes.

## Features

- Retrieve device data for logging and analytics
- Create device identifier based on device data

## Installing

### Package manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm i @keyri/xray
```

### Using CDN:

```html
<!-- Adding library from NPM via UNPKG -->
<script type="module">
  // Pull Library from CDN
  import { XRAY } from 'https://unpkg.com/@keyri/xray/index.mjs';
</script>
```

## Usage

Once the package is installed, you can import the library as follows. The
library outputs an encrypted client object that you first pass to your server
and thereafter use to make requests to the Keyri API.

```javascript
import { XRAY } from '@keyri/xray';

const _xray = new XRAY(); // Instantiate the library
await _xray.load(); // Load into memory
const xray = _xray.xray; // Expose the main functionality

// Get Encrypted Analytics Payload returned locally
const encrypted_fraud_data = await xray.scan({ apiUrl: 'local' });
```

### Data Transmission

Send the collected data to your server using your preferred method (Attached to
a form submission, XHR, WebSockets, WebRTC, etc.).

Example payload from `xray.scan()`:

```json
{
  "encryptedB64Payload": "eyJjbGllbnRFbmNyeX...U4UmVJK09wOHc9PSJ9"
}
```
