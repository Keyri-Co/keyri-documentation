# Standard Event Types

The risk rules engine is preconfigured to accept common event types that are
seen throughout the user journey. These event types are used by the built-in
rules for specific analyses. In addition to these preconfigured events, you can
also specify custom event types when sending the request to Keyri and use those
custom event types in custom rules.
