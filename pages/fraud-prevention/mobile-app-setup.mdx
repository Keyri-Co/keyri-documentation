# Mobile App Fraud Prevention

Keyri offers powerful mobile fingerprinting and device integrity verification,
accessible in as little as one line of code.

The SDK will:

- Generate a unique fingerprint which persists even when the app is deleted This
  is something many developers struggle with. It's quite easy to keep a
  fingerprint UNTIL the app is deleted, but persistence across installations is
  tricky. This is exacerbated by the ease with which bad actors can clear out
  records in the iOS Keychain or Android Secure Storage.
- Send the information to our API using a strong cryptography technique which
  ensures the information cannot be tampered with or intercepted Note: This
  information will be available on the Keyri Dashboard
- Verify device integrity to stop bad actors before they can reverse-engineer
  your application or do further damage. We have checks to protect against
  - Jailbreaks
  - Malicious sideloaded applications
  - Method swizzling
  - Code tampering
  - Emulators

## Requirements

- iOS: iOS 14+
- Android: API Level 23+

## Implementation and Installation

Fingerprinting and fraud prevention can be accomplished through two ways with
Keyri SDKs. You have the option to either use simple fingerprinting to
powerfully bind a user to their device or the full fraud analytics and
prevention system for full event intelligence.

### Methods

#### Simple Fingerprinting

- `func login(publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<LoginObject, Error>) -> ())`: Create object for login with timestamp_nonce, signature, publicKey, userId.
- `func register(publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<RegisterObject, Error>) -> ())`: Create object for register with publicKey, userId

#### Full Fraud Analytics and Prevention

- `func sendEvent(publicUserId: String, eventType: EventType, success: Bool, completion: (Result<FingerprintResponse, Error>) -> ())`:
  Send Keyri a fingerprint of the device directly from the app and have the
  results returned to the mobile app
- `func createFingerprint(completion: (Result<FingerprintResponse, Error>) -> ())`: Creates fingerprint of the device which can be sent directly to backend

### Example: Protecting Registration/Signup

The following example protects your registration/signup flow. Regardless of the
credentials that the user inputs when trying to create a new account (like a new
username), the Keyri methods included here will detect whether that device has
already registered an account, and if so, suggest to the user to log in with
that existing account rather than create a new one. Of course, you can implement
other logic like allowing up to two accounts, blocking certain accounts
altogether, etc.

## Android Accounts Backup

Preserving user-device fingerprints even after your app is deleted and
re-installed requires additional backup configuration steps. This document will
help you set up your account backup configuration.

You can find a comparison of Key/Value Backup and Auto Backup here:
[Android Backup Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup).

Keyri backup file `keyri_backup_prefs` is a SharedPreferences file that contains
Keyri accounts. You need to keep this file after app uninstall to prevent a loss
of accounts. There are two options for how to do it.

### Android Auto Backup

Auto Backup for Apps automatically backs up a user's data from apps that target
and run on Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

Make sure that backup is not disabled in your application. `allowBackup` should
not be false. The default value is true but to make your intentions clear, we
recommend explicitly setting the attribute in your manifest as shown below:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <application android:allowBackup="true">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

[](https://github.com/Keyri-Co/keyri-android-whitelabel-sdk/blob/master/keyrisdk/src/main/java/com/keyrico/keyrisdk/backup/BACKUP.md#control-backup-on-android-11-and-lower)**Control
backup on Android 11 and lower**

Follow the steps in this section to include or exclude files that are backed up
on devices running Android 11 (API level 30) or lower.

1.  In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the `android:fullBackupContent` attribute to
    the `<application>` element. This attribute points to an XML file that
    contains backup rules. For example:

```xml
<application android:fullBackupContent="@xml/backup_rules">
    ...
</application>
```

2. Create an XML file called `@xml/backup_rules` in the `res/xml/` directory.
   Inside the file, add rules with the `<include>` and `<exclude>` elements. The
   following sample backs up all shared preferences except device.xml:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<full-backup-content>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="." />
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="device.xml" />
</full-backup-content>
```

If you have more granular control over sharedPref backups, make sure you have
included an `keyri_backup_prefs.xml` file.

[](https://github.com/Keyri-Co/keyri-android-whitelabel-sdk/blob/master/keyrisdk/src/main/java/com/keyrico/keyrisdk/backup/BACKUP.md#control-backup-on-android-12-or-higher)

**Control backup on Android 12 or higher**

If your app targets Android 12 (API level 31) or higher, follow the steps in
this section to include or exclude files that are backed up on devices that are
running Android 12 or higher.

1.  In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the `android:dataExtractionRules` attribute to
    the `<application>` element. This attribute points to an XML file that
    contains backup rules. For example:

```xml
<application android:dataExtractionRules="backup_rules.xml">
    ...
</application>
```

2. Create an XML file called `backup_rules.xml` in the `res/xml/` directory.
   Inside the file, add rules with the `<include>` and `<exclude>` elements. The
   following sample backs up all shared preferences `except device.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<data-extraction-rules>
    <cloud-backup>
        <include domain="sharedpref" path="." />
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="device.xml" />
    </cloud-backup>
</data-extraction-rules>
```

If you have more granular control over sharedPref backups, make sure you have
include `keyri_backup_prefs.xml` file.

Check for more details
on [Back up user data with Auto Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup).

### Key/Value Backup (Android Backup Service)

Android Backup Service provides cloud storage backup and restore for key-value
data in your Android app. During a key-value backup operation, the app's backup
data is passed to the device's backup transport. If the device is using the
default Google backup transport, then the data is passed to Android Backup
Service for archiving. Data is limited to 5MB per user of your app. There is no
charge for storing backup data.

`Note: Key-value backup requires you to write code to define your backup content explicitly, while Auto Backup requires no code and will back up entire files. Most apps should use Auto Backup to implement backup and restore. Your app can implement Auto Backup or key-value backup, but not both.`

[](https://github.com/Keyri-Co/keyri-android-whitelabel-sdk/blob/master/keyrisdk/src/main/java/com/keyrico/keyrisdk/backup/BACKUP.md#implement-key-value-backup)**Implement
key-value backup**

To back up your app data, you need to implement a backup agent. Your backup
agent is called by the Backup Manager both during backup and restore.

To implement a backup agent, you must:

1.  Declare your backup agent in your manifest file with the
    android\:backupAgent attribute.

2.  Define a backup agent by doing one of the following:

- Extending BackupAgent The BackupAgent class provides the central interface
  that your app uses to communicate with the Backup Manager. If you extend this
  class directly, you must override `onBackup()` and `onRestore()` to handle the
  backup and restore operations for your data.

- Extending BackupAgentHelper The BackupAgentHelper class provides a convenient
  wrapper around the `BackupAgent` class, minimizing the amount of code you need
  to write. In your `BackupAgentHelper`, you must use one or more helper
  objects, which automatically back up and restore certain types of data, so
  that you don't need to implement `onBackup()` and `onRestore()`. Unless you
  need full control over your app's backups, we recommend using
  the `BackupAgentHelper` to handle your app's backups.

Android currently provides backup helpers that will back up and restore complete
files from SharedPreferences and internal storage.

You can implement your own backup according to the documentation:
[Back up key-value pairs with Android Backup Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup).
In this case just include `keyri_backup_prefs` string to your BackupAgentHelper
as shown below:

<Tabs items={['Kotlin', 'Java']}>
<Tab>
```kotlin copy
class MyBackupAgent : BackupAgentHelper() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        val helper = SharedPreferencesBackupHelper(this, "your prefs files (optional)", "keyri_backup_prefs")

        addHelper("YOUR BACKUP KEY", helper)
    }
}

````
</Tab>
<Tab>
```java copy
public class MyBackupAgent extends BackupAgentHelper() {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        SharedPreferencesBackupHelper helper = SharedPreferencesBackupHelper(this, "your prefs files (optional)", "keyri_backup_prefs");

        addHelper("YOUR BACKUP KEY", helper);
    }
}

````
</Tab>
</Tabs>

After it just add your `MyBackupAgent` to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application android:backupAgent="MyBackupAgent">
        <activity>
            ...
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Or you can just use
our [KeyriPrefsBackupAgent](https://github.com/Keyri-Co/keyri-android-whitelabel-sdk/blob/master/keyrisdk/src/main/java/com/keyrico/keyrisdk/backup/KeyriPrefsBackupAgent.kt) which
implements the necessary logic under the hood as shown below:&#x20;

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application android:backupAgent="com.keyrico.keyrisdk.backup.KeyriPrefsBackupAgent">
        <activity>
            ...
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### Testing backup

See
[Test backup and restore](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/testingbackup)
to test backup of Keyri accounts.

## Privacy Disclosures

When submitting your Android app that uses the Keyri SDK for fingerprinting, be
sure to disclose the following data collection practice:

| Data Types          | Collected | Shared | Processed ephemerally | Required or Optional | Purposes  |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Device or other IDs | Yes       | Yes    | No                    | Required             | Analytics |

An analogous disclosure is not required for iOS apps, since the device data is
not used by Keyri for cross-app tracking.
