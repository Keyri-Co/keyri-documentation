# Get Started with Keyri Fraud Prevention

First, create a service on the Keyri dashboard and get your API key and
encryption key pair from the "Setup & Credentials" page. Also note your App Key
if you want to implement fraud prevention in a native mobile app.

Look through the fraud prevention logs page to see what kind of data is made
available to you. You can double-click on an event log to see full details.

Now proceed to the [web app setup](/fraud-prevention/web-app-setup) or the
[mobile app setup](/fraud-prevention/mobile-app-setup) pages to get started with
integration.
