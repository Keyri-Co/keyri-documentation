# Keyri Custom Rules - Examples

Here you'll find example solutions to common problems as copy-and-paste code
snippets with explanations. These can be used both with our no-code rule builder
and
[low-code rule builder](/fraud-prevention/custom-rules/low-code-rule-builder).

## General Rules

### Reduce False Positives

Everyone hates captchas, especially when they're not doing anything suspicious
on a site they visit frequently. You can enhance the user experience
significantly by implementing this simple rule. It allows known good users
(probably 98%) to bypass certain checks, reserving stricter measures for those
you're less certain about.

#### How it Works

If you've seen user `a@b.com` on device `abc123` 15 times in the last 3 months,
you can be fairly certain they're not a bad actor, and they can supersede any
other rules that might have been triggered.

#### Code

```json copy
{
  "rule": "established_user_device_allow",
  "conditions": {
    "deviceModel.deviceAgeUser": { "$gte": 7 },
    "deviceModel.daysUserSeenOnDeviceCount": { "$gte": 2 },
    "deviceModel.lieProbability": { "$lte": 0.2 }
  },
  "outcome": "allow",
  "signal": "established_user_device_allow",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

#### Explanation

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "established_user_device_allow".
- `outcome`: Set to "allow", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  allowed.
- `strength`: A value of 2 means it will override other rules with a lower
  strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule:
  - `deviceModel.deviceAgeUser`: If the device and user combo is older than 6
    days, it returns true.
  - `deviceModel.daysUserSeenOnDeviceCount`: If the user has appeared on this
    device on 2 or more distinct days, it returns true.
  - `deviceModel.lieProbability`: The likelihood of device tampering should be
    under 20% to return true.

### Automatically Block Users With Too Many Denials

You don't want to give bad actors unlimited attempts to try logging into a
user's account, right? The best policy is to lock the user's account.

#### How It Works

You're blocking User ID's with more than `count` denials in a given period.
After too many denials occur for this account - it can't be used for 10 minutes,
an hour, a day, or until the user provides some additional guidance and
verification.

#### Code

```json copy
{
  "rule": "too_many_user_denials",
  "conditions": {
    "$or": [
      { "historicalData.user._denials_10_minutes": { "$gte": 3 } },
      { "historicalData.user._denials_hour": { "$gte": 5 } }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "deny_user_id_list",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

#### Explanation

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_user_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: Doesn't have to be set. We're letting it default to 1.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true
  - `historicalData.user._denials_10_minutes`: If there are more than 2 denials in
    10 minutes on this IP - block it for 10 minutes
  - `historicalData.user._denials_hour`: If there are more than 4 denials in 1
    hour on this IP - block it for an hour

---

### Automatically Block Abusive IP Addresses

If the IP Address you're evaluating is associated with 326 login denials in last
24 hours, you probably don't want to let any one use it, right?

#### How It Works

You're blocking IP Addresses with more than `count` denials in a given period.
After too many denials occur on the IP Address - nobody can use it for 10
minutes, an hour, etc.

#### Code

```json copy
{
  "rule": "too_many_ip_denials",
  "conditions": {
    "$or": [
      { "historicalData.ip._denials_10_minutes": { "$gte": 3 } },
      { "historicalData.ip._denials_hour": { "$gte": 10 } }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "deny_ip_list",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

#### Explanation

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_ip_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: Doesn't have to be set. We're letting it default to 1.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true
  - `historicalData.ip._denials_10_minutes`: If there are more than 2 denials in 10
    minutes on this IP - block it
  - `historicalData.ip._denials_hour`: If there are more than 9 denials in 1
    hour on this IP - block it

---

### Too Many IP Changes

If the user or device coming in has been on 10 or more IP addresses over the
course of the day, you might want to engage in step-up-authentication, as this
is pretty suspicious.

#### How It Works

If the user or device has been on 4 or more unique IP Addresses in 24 hours,
we'll want to deny.

#### Code

```json copy
{
  "rule": "too_many_ip_addresses",
  "conditions": {
    "$or": [
      { "historicalData.user.uniqueIp._totals_24_hours": { "$gte": 4 } },
      { "historicalData.device.uniqueIp._totals_24_hours": { "$gte": 4 } }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "deny_ip_list",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

#### Explanation

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_ip_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: Doesn't have to be set. We're letting it default to 1.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true
  - `historicalData.user.uniqueIp._totals_24_hours`: If there are more than 3 IP
    Addresses for this user in 24 hours - block it
  - `historicalData.device.uniqueIp._totals_24_hours`: If there are more than 3 IP
    Addresses for this device in 24 hours - block it

### Block Users on New Device and VPN

Leverage the `threat` object to determine whether the user is using a VPN and
the `changed` boolean value under `deviceUsers` to determine whether that
user-device combination is new.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "New Device and VPN - deny",
  "conditions": {
    "$and": [
      {
        "instanceDeltas.deviceUsers.changed": {
          "$eq": true
        }
      },
      {
        "threat.is_vpn": {
          "$eq": true
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "new_device_and_vpn",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

### Only Allow Users from a Certain Country

The following rule will only allow users from the US to access your site. The
user's country is denoted in the `ipGeoData.country_code` property.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "Only allow users from the US",
  "conditions": {
    "ipGeoData.country_code": {
      "$ne": "US"
    }
  },
  "outcome": "block",
  "signal": "only_allow_users_from_us",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

### Override Keyri's Risk Determination with your Own Risk Model

If you already have a risk model, you can use it in conjunction with Keyri
rulesets or use its determination to simply override Keyri's determination. Pass
in your risk score as metadata and use it in your ruleset. In this example,
we're overriding Keyri if the risk score from your model is very low. It has a
`strength` value of 2 to override rules with the default strength value of 1.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "Override Keyri with own risk model",
  "conditions": {
    "$and": [
      {
        "metadata.riskScore": {
          "$lte": 5
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "allow",
  "signal": "override_keyri_with_own_risk_model",
  "strength": 10,
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Financial Rules

### Limit Transactions to a Certain Amount

If you want to limit the amount of money that can be transferred in a single
event, you can add metadata when triggering the event to indicate the amount. Be
sure to name the metadata field the same as the one in the rule. Here's it's
named `amount`.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "Transaction threshold - $1000",
  "conditions": {
    "$and": [
      {
        "eventMetadata.amount": {
          "$gt": 1000
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "Transaction_threshold_exceeded",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

### Limit Transaction Totals over a Period of Time

You can use built-in math functionality to query and sum the total value of the
amounts a given user has transacted over a period of time.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "24-hour spend threshold - $2500",
  "conditions": {
    "$and": [
      {
        "2500": {
          "$lte": {
            "$sum": [
              "userModel.metadata.amount._sum_24_hours",
              "eventMetadata.amount"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "eventMetadata.amount": {
          "$gt": 0
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "24-hour_spend_threshold_exceeded",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

### Block High-Value Transactions from a New Country

Use this rule to block a high-value transaction from a country that the user has
never been in before.

```json copy
{
  "rule": "new_country_high_value_txn",
  "conditions": {
    "$and": [
      {
        "instanceDeltas.country_code.changed": { "$eq": true }
      },
      {
        "eventMetadata.amount": { "$gte": 10000 }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "high_value_new_country",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2
}
```

### Transaction Anomaly Detection

Your compliance rules say that a user can't have more than 5 transactions over
$1,000 in a 72 hour time period. Here's how you can do that:

```json copy
{
  "rule": "Transaction Anomaly Detected", // This is the rule's name
  "outcome": "deny", // This is what happens if our "conditions" are true
  "signal": "transaction_anomaly_detected", // The string that will be returned to you if the rule is triggered
  "enabled": true, // This means the rule is to be used if it is true
  "strength": 2, // This means the rule overrides anything with a strength < 2
  "conditions": {
    // This defines the rule's logic - it resolves to true or false
    "$transform": [
      // Add the number 4 to the object for later use as 'testValue'
      { "testValue": 4 },
      // Put the value from the following calculation on the object
      // as 'actualValue'
      {
        "actualValue": {
          // glorified "sumIf" function
          "$reduce": {
            // What field are we summing?
            "input": "userModel.rawMetaData",
            // What number do we want to start with
            "initialValue": 0,
            // What criteria does each element need to meet to
            // added to the total?
            "conditions": {
              // This is an explicit 'AND' so all things must
              // be true
              "$and": [
                // the 'value' field must be >= 500
                { "value": { "$gte": 500 } },
                // the 'attribute' field must EQUAL the
                // string 'metadata.amount' for this example
                { "attribute": { "$eq": "metadata.amount" } },
                // the 'hoursAgo' field must be >= 0
                { "hoursAgo": { "$gte": 0 } },
                // the 'hoursAgo' field must be <= 72
                { "hoursAgo": { "$lte": 72 } }
              ]
            },
            // What do we want to do to each element that meets
            // our criteria?
            "math": {
              // We're to sum ('$sum') the running total ('$$value')
              // and the value of the element's 'count' field
              "$sum": ["$$value", "count"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    // We're out of the "$transform" function and can now do logic
    // against the values we added to the object ("actualValue", "testValue")
    "$and": [
      // If the "actualValue" (the sumIf) >= "testValue" (4)
      { "actualValue": { "$gte": "testValue" } },
      // AND the "eventMetadata.amount" >= 500
      { "eventMetadata.amount": { "$gte": 500 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

This one is verbose - but not really that bad once you see what's going on.

#### Explanation

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "Transaction Anomaly Detected" (name
  it whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: Optional. Determines the overriding behavior of this rule over
  others of lesser strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule.
  - `$transform`: This function is an array of things that you want _add_ to the
    object, or things you want to update. In this case, we're writing the number
    `4` directly to the object so we can use it in logic later. We're also
    summing up all transactions with the `reduce` function.
