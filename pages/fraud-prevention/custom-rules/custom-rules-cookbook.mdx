# Keyri Custom Rules - Examples

Here you'll find example solutions to common problems as copy-and-paste code
snippets with explanations. These can be used both with our no-code rule builder
and
[low-code rule builder](/fraud-prevention/custom-rules/low-code-rule-builder).

## General Rules

### Reduce False Positives

Everyone hates captchas, especially when they're not doing anything suspicious
on a site they visit frequently. You can enhance the user experience
significantly by implementing this simple rule. It allows known good users
(probably 98%) to bypass certain checks, reserving stricter measures for those
you're less certain about.

#### How it Works:

If you've seen user `a@b.com` on device `abc123` 15 times in the last 3 months,
you can be fairly certain they're not a bad actor, and they can supersede any
other rules that might have been triggered.

#### Code:

```json
{
  "rule": "established_user_device_allow",
  "strength": 2,
  "conditions": {
    "deviceModel.deviceAgeUser": { "$gte": 7 },
    "deviceModel.daysUserSeenOnDeviceCount": { "$gte": 2 },
    "deviceModel.lieProbability": { "$lte": 0.2 }
  },
  "outcome": "allow",
  "signal": "established_user_device_allow",
  "strength": 2,
  "enabled": true,
  "notes": "Allow if device age is at least 7 days, the user has been seen on the device at least 2 times, and the lie probability is less than or equal to 0.2; strength: 2"
}
```

#### Explanation:

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "established_user_device_allow".
- `outcome`: Set to "allow", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  allowed.
- `strength`: A value of 2 means it will override other rules with a lower
  strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule:
  - `deviceModel.deviceAgeUser`: If the device and user combo is older than 6
    days, it returns true.
  - `deviceModel.daysUserSeenOnDeviceCount`: If the user has appeared on this
    device on 2 or more distinct days, it returns true.
  - `deviceModel.lieProbability`: The likelihood of device tampering should be
    under 20% to return true.

### Automatically Block Users With Too Many Denials

You don't want to give bad actors unlimited attempts to try logging into a
user's account, right? The best policy is to lock the user's account.

#### How It Works

You're blocking User ID's with more than `count` denials in a given period.
After too many denials occur for this account - it can't be used for 10 minutes,
an hour, a day, or until the user provides some additional guidance and
verification.

#### Code:

```json
    {
      "rule": "too_many_user_denials",
      "conditions": {
        "$or": [
          { "historicalData.user._denials_10_min_": { "$gte": 3 } },
          { "historicalData.user._denials_hour_": { "$gte": 5 } }
        ]
      },
      "outcome": "deny",
      "signal": "deny_user_id_list",
      "enabled": true,
      "strength": 2,
      "notes": "Deny if user has previously been denied at least 3 times in the past 10 minutes or at least 5 times in the past hour; strength: 2"
    },
```

#### Explanation:

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_user_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: A value of 2 means it will override other rules with a lower strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true.
  - `historicalData.user._denials_10_min_`: If there are more than 2 denials in
    10 minutes on this IP - block it for 10 minutes.
  - `historicalData.user._denials_hour_`: If there are more than 4 denials in 1
    hour on this IP - block it for an hour.

### Automatically Block Abusive IP Addresses

If the IP Address you're evaluating is associated with 326 login denials in last
24 hours, you probably don't want to let any one use it, right?

#### How It Works

You're blocking IP Addresses with more than `count` denials in a given period.
After too many denials occur on the IP Address - nobody can use it for 10
minutes, an hour, etc.

#### Code:

```json
{
  "rule": "too_many_ip_denials",
  "conditions": {
    "$or": [
      { "historicalData.ip._denials_10_min_": { "$gte": 3 } },
      { "historicalData.ip._denials_hour_": { "$gte": 10 } }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "deny_ip_list",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2,
  "notes": "Deny if IP has previously been denied at least 3 times in the past 10 minutes or at least 10 times in the past hour; strength: 2"
}
```

#### Explanation:

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_ip_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: A value of 2 means it will override other rules with a lower strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true.
  - `historicalData.ip._denials_10_min_`: If there are more than 2 denials in 10
    minutes on this IP - block it.
  - `historicalData.ip._denials_hour_`: If there are more than 9 denials in 1
    hour on this IP - block it.

### Too Many IP Changes

If the user or device coming in has been on 10 or more IP addresses over the
course of the day, you might want to engage in step-up-authentication, as this
is pretty suspicious.

#### How It Works

If the user or device has been on 4 or more unique IP Addresses in 24 hours,
we'll want to deny.

#### Code:

```json
{
  "rule": "too_many_ip_addresses",
  "conditions": {
    "$or": [
      { "historicalData.user.uniqueIp._totals_day_": { "$gte": 4 } },
      { "historicalData.device.uniqueIp._totals_day_": { "$gte": 4 } }
    ]
  },
  "outcome": "deny",
  "signal": "deny_ip_list",
  "enabled": true,
  "strength": 2,
  "notes": "Deny if device or user has been seen on at least 4 unique IP addresses in the past 24 hours; strength: 2"
}
```

#### Explanation:

- `rule`: The name of the rule, here it's "too_many_ip_denials" (name it
  whatever you want).
- `outcome`: Set to "deny", so if the rule evaluates to true, the event is
  denied.
- `strength`: A value of 2 means it will override other rules with a lower strength.
- `conditions`: Defines the criteria for the rule. In this case they're nested
  in an "or" array so if any are true - the whole rule returns as true.
  - `historicalData.user.uniqueIp._totals_day_`: If there are more than 3 IP
    Addresses for this user in 24 hours - block it.
  - `historicalData.device.uniqueIp._totals_day_`: If there are more than 3 IP
    Addresses for this device in 24 hours - block it.
