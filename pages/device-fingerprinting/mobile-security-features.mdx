# Mobile Security

Keyri has been designed with security in mind. We started with our auth products, and quickly realized the number of threats that we faced from various angles. On the mobile side, we built a whole suite of serucity checks into the SDK. Realizing later that we now have a best in class solution, we decided to productize it as a standalone feature.

### Features

The SDK can be utilized for 

* Emulator detection
* Jailbreak Detection
* Method Swizzle Detection
* Presence of known malicious apps and packages
* Code Tamper Detection
* Runtime injection detction
* [Coming soon] Obfucscation and hardening
