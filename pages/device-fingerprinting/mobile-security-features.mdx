# Mobile Security

Keyri has been designed with security in mind. For mobile app protection, we have built a suite of security checks into the SDKs when Keyri methods are called. Realizing later that these security checks constitute a best in class solution, we decided to productize them as standalone features that can be implemented throughout your application.

## Features

The SDK can be utilized for

- Emulator detection
- Jailbreak detection
- Method swizzle detection
- Presence of known malicious apps and packages on the device
- Code tamper detection
- Runtime injection detction
- [Coming soon] Obfucscation and hardening

## Implementation

See [mobile SDK documentation](/mobile-sdks) for details
