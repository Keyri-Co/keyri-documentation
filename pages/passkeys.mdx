description: Keyri has SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, and React Native that make it easy to add QR login to your app as well as provide additional security to your whole app. Our SDKs handle the secure cryptographic key generation, key storage, encryption, API communications, desktop session identification, session management, and QR scanning required to make a QR login system work.

# Passkeys

## What Are They?

Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to log in to websites and online accounts using your biometric data or a physical device, while protecting your privacy and reducing the risk of password-related security breaches without the installation of a new app.

Good News! Keyri provides this out of the box for desktop and QR authentication use cases.

## Setup

_(this assumes you've already installed `keyri-auth-core`. If not, just npm i `keyri-auth-core`)_

Somewhere in your application, instantiate and export `ApplessLocal` from `keyri-auth-core` with information about where your api-end-points are (more on that in a minute)

```js

//
// This file sets up our "localAppless" object
// and exposes some functions that we can tie to buttons
// to
//

import { ApplessLocal } from "keyri-auth-core";

//
// Instantiate the `ApplessLocal` class, telling it where your
// passkey-registration-route and passkey-validation-route are 
//
let localAppless = new ApplessLocal(
  "./api/passkey/register",
  "./api/passkey/login"
);

//
// export your live object for use elsewhere in your project
//

export {localAppless}
```
