# Passkeys

## What Are They?

Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to log in to websites and online accounts using your biometric data or a physical device, while protecting your privacy and reducing the risk of password-related security breaches without the installation of a new app.

Good News! Keyri provides this out of the box for desktop and QR authentication use cases.

## Setup
