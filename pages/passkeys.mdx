description: Keyri has SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, and React Native that make it easy to add QR login to your app as well as provide additional security to your whole app. Our SDKs handle the secure cryptographic key generation, key storage, encryption, API communications, desktop session identification, session management, and QR scanning required to make a QR login system work.

# Passkeys

## What Are They?

Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to log in to websites and online accounts using your biometric data or a physical device, while protecting your privacy and reducing the risk of password-related security breaches without the installation of a new app.

Good News! Keyri provides this out of the box for desktop and QR authentication use cases.

## Desktop Client Setup

_(this assumes you've already installed `keyri-auth-core`. If not, just npm i `keyri-auth-core`)_

Somewhere in your application, instantiate and export `ApplessLocal` from `keyri-auth-core` with information about where your api-end-points are (more on that in a minute)

```js

//
// This file sets up our "localAppless" object
// and exposes some functions that we can tie to buttons
// to
//

import { ApplessLocal } from "keyri-auth-core";

//
// Instantiate the `ApplessLocal` class, telling it where your
// passkey-registration-route and passkey-validation-route are 
//
let localAppless = new ApplessLocal(
  "./api/passkey/register",
  "./api/passkey/login"
);

//
// export your live object for use elsewhere in your project
//

export {localAppless}
```

## Server Setup

You need to set up two routes (`registration`,`authentication`) to verify the information the client is providing you is valid.

### Registration

```js
import * as KeyriServerTools  from "keyri-front-end";

//
// The publicSignatureKey and privateSignatureKey come from the Keyri-Dashboard.
// In a production Environment, these variables are .env variables
//
import {publicSignatureKey, privateSignatureKey} from "./keys.mjs";
const {passkeyRegister} = KeyriServerTools.default.ApplessServer; 

const host = "my.app.com";

export async function passkey_registration(req, res, nxt)  {

    // SINCE the user is already signed in, get their information
    // through your IDP, their session cookie, whatever
    // 
    // This next line is just pseudo-code:
    //
    const {userId, userName, userInfo}  = IdProvider.getUserInfo(req);

    //
    // This generates the response you need to register passkeys on your
    // device
    //
    let response = await passkeyRegister(
        publicSignatureKey, 
        privateSignatureKey, 
        req.body, 
        host, 
        userId, 
        userName,
        userInfo);

    res.status(200).send(response);
}
```


### Login 

```javascript
import * as KeyriServerTools  from "keyri-auth-core";
import {publicSignatureKey, apiPublicKey} from "./keys.mjs";
const {passkeyLogin} = KeyriServerTools.default.ApplessServer; 

export async function passkey_validation(req, res, nxt)  {
    let response = await passkeyLogin(apiPublicKey, req.body, publicSignatureKey);
    res.status(200).send({message:"YOU ARE OK TO LOG IN!"});
}

```
