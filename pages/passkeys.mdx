# About Passkeys

Introducing our innovative product, Passkeys, designed to simplify passkey implementation and enhance user experience. Passkeys allows developers to utilize our infrastructure for free, enabling seamless same-device passkey registration and login for both developers and users.

## Free Features

- Easy-to-use infrastructure for same-device passkey registration and login
- Streamlined passkey implementation process

## Premium Features

- Cross-device passkey login via QR code, eliminating the need for Bluetooth
- Passkey backups using QR codes, without relying on cloud storage

Our goal is to make passkey implementation 10 times easier for developers. We believe our solution achieves this with its user-friendly features. Additionally, we have developed innovative solutions for using passkeys across devices and platforms without Bluetooth and for backing up passkeys without cloud storage dependence. These solutions are available as premium features at a minimal cost.
