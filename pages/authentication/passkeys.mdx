# Passkey Overview

Keyri enables you to use Passkeys with any backend as well as over QR, with your user scanning a QR code and being taken to their mobile browser to complete their biometrics check, which in turn authorizes their desktop browser application.

Below is a high level overview of what setting up passkeys with our architecture looks like.

## Browser

1. Add the [QR iframe](./passkeys/desktop-browser) to your login page
2. Install the library
3. Configure the library to handle user-triggered events registration, authentication, etc
4. Set up the library to handle QR-triggered events (info from API - risk data, errors, registrations, etc)

## [Server](./passkeys/server)

1. Set up passkey registration endpoint
2. Create passkey validation endpoint

## [Mobile Web Application](../passkeys/mobile-browser)

1. Import the library
2. Handle Registration Events
3. Handle Authentication Events
