# Authentication Risk Analytics

Keyri's Scaling and Enterprise plans provide you and your users with IP-based risk analytics that block man-in-the-middle phishing attacks.

Keyri's risk analytics system incorporates the following signals, each of which can be configured in the [Dashboard](https://app.keyri.com) to "Allow", "Warn", or "Deny" a login attempt.

- Distance between web client and mobile authenticator device

- Country differential between web client and mobile authenticator device

- Web client accessing service through a TOR IP

- Web client accessing service through a known attacker IP

- Web client accessing service through an anonymous proxy such as a black-market SOCKS5 proxy

With risk analytics, the mobile SDK's built-in confirmation modal will include enriched information about the login attempt that the user can utilize to make an informed decision as to whether or not to log in. In the same vein, if you configure one of the risk signals to "Deny" a login attempt if it is detected, the mobile confirmation modal will inform the user that the login attempt has been denied and the reason for that denial.

The screenshots of the built-in confirmation modals below represent different risk signal scenarios:
