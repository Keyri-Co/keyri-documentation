# Smart Deep Linking

![](/smartDeepLinking.png)

Deep linking refers to the mechanism in which a URI, presented in any interface or context, takes your user to a specific location or function within your mobile app. Parameters in the URI are then fed into the location / function to trigger a specific action.

Keyri's QR codes encode an ordinary URL for a web page that has a `sessionId` query parameter. When visited on a mobile device, JavaScript on this webpage instantly detects the operating system of the user's device and generates the OS-specific URI to take them to your app to initiate QR login, passing along the `sessionId` that the Keyri SDK in your app then consumes.

This means that your users can initiate QR login just by scanning the login code from their phone's camera app. On iOS, all they have to do is swipe left on the lock screen to open the camera, and on Android, all they have to do is double-tap the power button. The deep linking mechanism saves your user from having to unlock their phone, locate your app, and tap into a specific screen to initiate QR login. This allows for the entire QR login user journey to be completed from start to finish in under 1 second.

If your user does not have your mobile app installed, when they scan the login QR code, they will be automatically taken to your app's App Store or Play Store listing.

When you register your application on the [Keyri Dashboard](https://app.keyri.com) and verify your domain, we generate a `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to` subdomain. You need to provide all of the requested information about your app to allow Keyri to properly add your subdomain and its deep linking/redirection behavior. All QR codes on your client app will encode the following URL: `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to/?sessionId={sessionId}`. This URL hosts the JavaScript that takes users to your app to initiate QR login if they have your app installed, or to your App Store / Play Store listing if they do not. The URI that takes them into your app passes along the sessionId that is then fed into the Keyri SDK.

iOS calls its latest deep link scheme [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/), and Android employs an analogous system called [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links). Both systems require specific JSONs to be hosted in different directories of the domain you wish to associate your app with to enable deep linking. Keyri automatically handles the generation and hosting of the two JSONs for your `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to` subdomain, so the only thing you need to do to handle deep links in your apps is basic configuration as outlined in the [Mobile SDKs](./mobileSDKs) documentation.
