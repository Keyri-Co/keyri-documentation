# Mobile Device Fingerprinting - UX & Fraud

## Functionality

One major utility of the Keyri mobile SDKs is strong device fingerprinting; in other words, stably associating a given device on which your app is installed to a given user account or set of user accounts, then reading those associations when you want to in order to handle different situations. The fingerprint persists even if the user deletes your app and re-installs it.

All device Keyri fingerprinting functionality and intelligence takes place within the confines of your mobile app, through Keyri SDK methods. Custom logic can be set up on your mobile app or dictated by your backend based on the outputs of Keyri's mobile fingerprint-related methods.

This device fingerprinting and fingerprint reading functionality is independent of the authentication system you use, and the fingerprinting methods outlined below can be embedded into your existing signup and login functions as additional sources of data that enable further conditional app behavior.

## Use Cases

1.  **Avoid accidental multiple account creation:** during your registration flow, detect in the background even in an unauthenticated state, whether the user has used an account for your service in the past regardless of what credentials they are using to register the new account. While the user goes through your registration flow, you can call methods in the Keyri SDK, and if they return an account or list of accounts that have been used on that device before, you can suggest or force the user to log into one of those existing accounts, even if they used a different email address or phone number to attempt registering the new account.

2.  **Avoid fraudulent multiple account creation:** using the same existing-account-detection functionality outlined above, you can stop users from creating multiple accounts to exploit your app, such as signup bonus abuse and free trial abuse

3.  **Actually ban bad actors:** in social apps, while you can easily ban individual bad actor accounts by changing their account profiles / access rights, those same individuals can simply create new accounts and sockpuppets. Keyri SDK device fingerprinting methods can help you ensure that, for this group of users, creating a new account is more difficult than simply providing new credentials, such as a different email address, phone number, or a fresh re-installation of your app. Regardless of what new credentials or account identifiers these bad actors input while registering a new account, Keyri SDK methods will inform you that they have already created at least one account before.

4.  **Continuous on-demand authentication:** Keyri cryptographic keys can be used to invisibly re-authenticate your users whenever you want, such as during a sensitive operation like changing their contact details or handle. For more details on this use, please see our [Server-Side Authentication](docId:OrYINPi6o-XhmgAalRl91) documentation.

## How to use Keyri Mobile Device Fingerprints

The two primary Keyri SDK methods used to implant and retrieve user-related device fingerprints are `generateAssociationKey(userIdentifier)` and `listAssociationKey()` respectively. The former is used to create a key pair for a user and return a public key that you can either ignore or save to your database for further use, such as continuous authentication. The latter is simply used to list the key pairs present on the device, associated with your app, as well as the user identifiers they are associated with, returning an array. If this array is empty, it is highly likely that the user has only recently installed your app and is a legitimate user, thereby allowing them to complete registration with no added friction. On the other hand, if this array is not empty, they can be confidently directed to log into their existing account.

### Example: Protecting Registration/Signup

The following example protects your registration/signup flow. Regardless of the credentials that the user inputs when trying to create a new account (like a new username), the Keyri methods included here will detect whether that device has already registered an account, and if so, suggest to the user to log in with that existing account rather than create a new one. Of course, you can implement other logic like allowing up to two accounts, blocking certain accounts altogether, etc. All you're getting when running `listAssociationKey()` is a useful, reliable array of accounts associated with that device, and you can parse and act upon it however you'd like.
