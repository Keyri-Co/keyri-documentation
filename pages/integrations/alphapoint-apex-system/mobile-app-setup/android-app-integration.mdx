# Keyri QR Login - AlphaPoint Android Apps

## Install Keyri SDK

Add SDK dependency to your **build.gradle** file and sync project:

```kotlin copy
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.keyri:keyrisdk:${AndroidSDKVersion}")
}
```

## Set Up User Login

Please refer to [Android documentation](/mobile-sdks/android) for detailed instructions about how to set up the SDK to handle Authentication via URL Deep linking and/or a built in Scanner

### Provision and retrieve API login credentials from the APEX WebSocket API Using `GetAPICredentials()`

Keyri's session object has a "payload" field in which you can input any data, which will be encrypted all the way to the browser when the user scans the login QR code and the valid session is confirmed. You can fetch the user's API credentials from the APEX user management system at any point before this, and populate this field with the API credentials before going on to confirm the session. Please see the sample code below

**Important Note:** The `APIKey` and `APISecret` will be decommissioned as soon as the user is logged in on the browser.

This function can be activated once the login QR code has been scanned and parsed, either from a Universal Link (iOS) / App Link (Android) or your app's built-in QR code scanner.

Construct the function as follows:

1. Send the following message to `wss://apexapi.{yourDomain}/WSGateway` with the user's `UserId`:

```json copy
{
  "m": 0,
  "i": 76,
  "n": "AddUserAPIKey",
  "o": "{\"UserId\":{UserId},\"Permissions\":[\"Trading\",\"Withdraw\",\"Deposit\"]}"
}
```

2. In return, you will receive an `APIKey` and `APISecret` as follows:

```json copy
{
  "m": 1,
  "i": 76,
  "n": "AddUserAPIKey",
  "o": "{\"APIKey\":\"...\",\"APISecret\":\"...\",\"UserId\":[UserId],\"Permissions\":[\"Trading\",\"Withdraw\",\"Deposit\"],\"Nonce\":0}"
}
```

3. Finally, the function must return values for `APIKey`, `APISecret`, and `UserId`. These three items will subsequently be passed into the Keyri `initiateQrSession()` method. Please see the [Android App Integration](/mobile-sdks/android) page for details on how this function is invoked

This _example_ uses Native Android functions to handle websockets

```kotlin copy
fun getApiCredentials(data: SocketMessage): String {
    val socket = Socket("wss://apexapi.{yourDomain}/WSGateway", PORT)
    val dataOutputStream = DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())

    dataOutputStream.writeUTF(data.toSocketData())
    dataOutputStream.flush()
    dataOutputStream.close()

    val dataInputStream = DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())
    val response = dataInputStream.readUTF()

    dataInputStream.close()
    socket.close()

    return response
}

data class SocketMessage(val m: Int, val i: Int, val n: String, val o: String) {
    fun toSocketData() = JsonObject().also {
        it.addProperty("m", m)
        it.addProperty("i", i)
        it.addProperty("n", n)
        it.addProperty("o", o)
    }.toString()
}
```
