# Passwordless Authentication

Keyri offers a comprehensive suite of passwordless authentication methods to
cover the full user journey, from registration to login.

1. EchoGuard authentication methods are designed to be familiar user experiences
   that are secure, easy to implement, and ideal for onboarding new users.
   - [Email Magic Link](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/email-magic-link) -
     An email containing a link with a secret query parameter is send to the
     user's email address. The user clicks the link to authenticate.
   - [Reverse SMS](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/reverse-sms) - An SMS
     message containing a secret is drafted for the user. The user taps a button
     or scans a QR code to send the message to Keyri. This reversed process is
     secure, easy to use, and cost effective compared to traditional SMS OTP
     strategies.
2. [Cryptographic Mobile Authentication](/passwordless-authentication/mobile-app-authentication) -
   A cryptographic key pair is established on the user's mobile device and
   stored in its Trusted Execution Environment. It is used to generate a
   cryptographic signature that is sent to your server for verification against
   the user's public key. This mechanism can be used after a biometrics check
   for a seamless passwordless MFA process, or it can be run in the background
   to provide continuous authentication.
3. [QR Authentication](/passwordless-authentication/qr-authentication) - A QR
   code is displayed the user's laptop, desktop, or smart TV. The user scans the
   QR code with their mobile device (that has your mobile app installed in it)
   to authenticate. This system uses the same cryptographic verification flow as
   the mobile app authentication method.
4. [Passkeys (WebAuthn)](/passwordless-authentication/passkeys) - A modern
   standard passwordless authentication system. Key pairs are established on the
   user's device and stored in its Trusted Execution Environment. The private
   key is used to sign a challenge from the Keyri server, and the public key is
   used to verify the signature. Keyri enhances the Passkey system by adding a
   QR authentication system that allows users to authenticate on a device that
   does not support WebAuthn or in situations where the user has Passkey
   credentials on their mobile phone but not on their laptop or desktop and is
   having issues with Bluetooth.
