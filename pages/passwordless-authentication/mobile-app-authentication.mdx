# Mobile App authentication

Keyri enables true passwordless authentication in mobile apps using
cryptographic credentials, which are embedded into your users' devices by the
Keyri mobile SDKs, and, optionally, phone biometrics or PIN. It is a simple and
secure way to authenticate users in your mobile app without the need for
memorizing passwords or typing unreliable SMS OTP codes and can be used for
primary, secondary, and continuous authentication in the background. When used
in conjunction with biometrics, it constitutes MFA in that it presents evidence
of what the user has (the device containing their cryptographic credentials) and
what the user is (their biometrics).

## How it Works: User + Mobile Device Signatures

Keyri's mobile SDKs include
[ECDSA](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages)
methods that allow you to tie an individual account to a specific device. These
methods associate a signing key pair to an account, and the private key is
persistent on and non-extractable from the device on which it was generated. The
private key is used to generate cryptographic signatures for a given account
that can then be validated by your backend application using the key pair's
public key, which is extractable from the device and can be passed to your
backend applications.

## Practical Example - iOS

Let's say you have a user with a username of "Jane" registering or logging into
your iOS app through any method - Keyri passwordless, standard password, social
login, email link, etc.

To generate a persistent key pair for Jane when she logs in, run
`func generateAssociationKey(publicUserId: "Jane").` This will create a private
key that will be stored in the phone's Secure Enclave, and return its associated
public key. You can pass this public key to your user database and associate it
with Jane's account, similar to how you would treat a hashed password.

To authenticate Jane, run
`func generateUserSignature(publicUserId: "Jane", data: Data("I'm trying to log in"))`,
with a biometrics (FaceID or TouchID) check optionally preceding it. This will
return a signature of the `data` from Jane's private key. Pass this `signature`
and `data` to your backend, and validate that signature on your backend with
ECDSA. If validated, then you can trust that Jane is using that specific device
on that specific session. You can opt to call this Keyri method without
biometrics at any time and thereby continuously authenticate Jane in the
background as well.

## Backend Setup

Configure an API endpoint to receive the `signature` and `data` from your app,
and validate the signature using the public key associated with the user's
account. The backend setup for passwordless authentication in your mobile app is
the same as that for server-side QR login: see
[documentation here](./server-setup) for a Node.js example.
