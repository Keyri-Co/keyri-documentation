# QR Authentication

Keyri's QR authentication allows your users to log into your web app just by
scanning a QR code with a phone camera and confirming the login event in your
mobile app. This multi-factor authentication flow is extremely secure and
convenient for your users, and can be used for either login or for any
subsequent high-risk events in your application.

The primary use of this system is to quickly launch QR authentication on your
multi-client platform. Your users will be able to use your mobile app to
authenticate into your desktop web platform or smart TV app, all without a
single click or keystroke. Our frontend Widget, mobile SDKs, and API handle the
heavy lifting, ensuring the smoothest UX and most secure architecture possible.

The only requirement for using the Keyri QR system is that your platform must
have both a mobile app and another client app that will show the QR code. The
client displays the QR code through the Keyri Widget, while the mobile app uses
the Keyri SDK to send payloads over to the Widget via our API.

If you currently only have a mobile app, you can launch a web app or other
client like a smart TV app without having to set up authentication on it, just
by installing the Keyri QR widget. In doing so, the authentication and
authorization system you already have in your mobile app will be instantly
extended to your new client app by sending authorization tokens to it from the
mobile app. Keyri integration into your system is comprised of three parts:

1. [Web frontend](./qr-authentication/qr-web-widget) (wherever the QR code is
   shown, for example, desktop or smart TV login page)
2. [Mobile app](./mobile-app-authentication) (use our mobile SDK in your app to
   send payloads to the Widget)
3. [Server](./server-setup) (optional: only required if going through the
   server-side authentication strategy, not
   [client session extension](./qr-authentication/session-extension))

Below is code for how to implement QR authentication on your mobile app. You must also install the [Keyri QR Widget](./qr-authentication/qr-web-widget). See[mobile SDK installation and initialization instructions](../mobile-sdks/installation) to get started on your mobile app.

## High-Level Overview

The Keyri flow proceeds as follows, taking QR login as an example:

1.  User navigates to web login page

    - Keyri QR widget loaded

      1.  Creates a session-specific P-256 keypair

      2.  Establishes a websocket connection with Keyri API

      3.  Receives session ID from Keyri API

      4.  Renders QR code with session ID

2.  User scans QR code with mobile phone containing your app

3.  Your app extracts the session ID from the QR code and hands it to the Keyri
    SDK

4.  SDK returns a session object and presents relevant security information to
    the user for their confirmation

5.  User confirms

6.  Application gives SDK a payload

    - In the case of client-side authorization, payload is the session token
      currently active in the app

    - In the case of server-side authentication, payload is an ECDSA-signed
      authentication request

7.  SDK encrypts payload using browser's public key

8.  Keyri API recieves encrypted payload and passes it back to Keyri widget on
    the browser to be decrypted

For a more visual representation of this flow and some more details into its
inner workings, see the diagrams on the
[client session extension](./qr-authentication/session-extension) and
[server-side authentication](./server-setup) documentation pages, each of which
represent two distinct ways to implement QR login with Keyri. The vast majority
of the steps you see here are automated by the Keyri Widget and mobile SDKs.
