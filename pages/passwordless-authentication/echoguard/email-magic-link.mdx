# EchoGuard Email Magic Link

EchoGuard provides a simple and secure email magic link solution that allows you
to authenticate users by proving that they own their email address. An email
containing a link with a secret query param is sent to an address they provide.
Once they click the link, they are directed to a page that extracts the query
param to verify they clicked a link only they could have received.

## Set up your Callback URL

First, create an endpoint on your backend that accepts a POST request. We will
send a webhook to this endpoint when the user clicks the magic link. The request
body will contain the user's email address and any metadata you provided when
you made the API call, as follows:

```json filename="Webhook"
{
  "confirmationId": [CONFIRMATION-ID],
  "email": [USER'S-PHONE-NUMBER],
  "validationStatus": "valid",
  "metadata": {
    [KEY-1]: [VALUE-1]
  },
  "timestamp": [TIME-OF-VERIFICATION]
}
```

It will additionally contain an `x-signature` header that is a SHA-256 ECDSA
signature of the request body. You can, optionally, use this signature to verify
that the request came from us. To do so, you will need to use our public key,
located here: [LINK](https://static.keyri.com/keyri-echo-guard-public-key).
Example verification code as follows:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'Django']}>
<Tab>
```javascript filename="Express Middleware" copy
const crypto = require('crypto');
const axios = require('axios');

const fetchPublicKey = async () => { const response = await
axios.get('https://static.keyri.com/keyri-echo-guard-public-key'); return
response.data; };

function signatureVerificationMiddleware(req, res, next) { const
verifyDataWithECDSA = async (data, signature, publicKey) => { const verify =
crypto.createVerify('SHA256'); verify.update(data); return verify.verify( { key:
publicKey, }, signature, 'base64' ); };

(async () => { try { const receivedData = JSON.stringify(req.body); const
receivedSignature = req.headers['x-signature']; const publicKey = await
fetchPublicKey(); const isValidSignature = await
verifyDataWithECDSA(receivedData, receivedSignature, publicKey);

    if (isValidSignature) {
      next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    } else {
      res.status(403).send('Invalid Signature');
    }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error verifying signature:", error);
      res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }

})(); }

<Tab>
```python filename="Utility Function" copy
import requests
import hashlib
from Crypto.Signature import DSS
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
from Crypto.PublicKey import ECC

def fetch_public_key():
  response = requests.get('https://static.keyri.com/keyri-echo-guard-public-key')
  return ECC.import_key(response.text)

def verify_data_with_ecdsa(data, signature, public_key):
  h = SHA256.new(data.encode())
  verifier = DSS.new(public_key, 'fips-186-3')
  try:
      verifier.verify(h, bytes.fromhex(signature))
      return True
  except ValueError:
      return False
````

```python filename="Django Middleware" copy
from django.http import JsonResponse

class SignatureVerificationMiddleware:
  def __init__(self, get_response):
      self.get_response = get_response

  def __call__(self, request):
      body = request.body.decode('utf-8')
      signature = request.headers.get('X-Signature')

      public_key = fetch_public_key()

      if not verify_data_with_ecdsa(body, signature, public_key):
          return JsonResponse({"error": "Invalid Signature"}, status=403)

      response = self.get_response(request)
      return response
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set Up Your Landing URL

Now create a static page on your frontend that will be the landing page that the
user arrives on after clicking the magic link. If your application is a mobile
app, this would be a deep link path. This page/path should contain a script that
makes a request to the EchoGuard API to verify the user's email address. The
request should include the `confirmation` secret string, that you derive from
the query params of the URL as follows:

```javascript filename="Landing URL" copy
const confirmationSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
  'confirmation'
);

const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.echoguard.keyri.com/verify-email',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        confirmationSecret,
      }),
    }
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  // handle the response
}
```

## API Call to Initiate Magic Link Flow

Now that you've set up your callback URL, you can make a request to our API to
confirm a user's email address. You can also, **optionally**, provide `metadata`
that will be included in the webhook so that you can more easily track the
status of the email confirmation "session" once we send the webhook based on
your backend architecture.

```shell filename="Request" copy
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.echoguard.keyri.com/confirm-email \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: [YOUR-API-KEY]' \
     --data-raw '
  {
    "email": [USERS-EMAIL-ADDRESS],
    "callbackUrl": [YOUR-CALLBACK-URL],
    "landingUrl": [YOUR-LANDING-URL],
    "metadata": {
        [KEY-1]: [VALUE-1],
        ...
    }
  }
'
```

In response, you will receive the following JSON object:

```json filename="Response"
{
  "confirmationId": [CONFIRMATION-ID],
  "email": [USERS-EMAIL-ADDRESS],
  "metadata": {
        [KEY-1]: [VALUE-1],
        ...
  },
  "expiresAt": "2023-08-30T19:12:19.293Z"
}
```

At this point, the email containing the magic link has been sent to the user.
The link will take them to your `landingUrl`, with an added `confirmation` query
param. The `landingUrl` should extract this query param and send it to
"https://api.echoguard.keyri.com/verify-email".

## Notifying the Client of Verification Status

We will only send the webhook if the user's verification was successful. Each
email confirmation session is valid for 5 minutes as indicated by the
`expiresAt` field we send when you initiate the flow, so be sure to implement a
timeout/refresh strategy. If the user does not click the magic link within that
period, the session will expire, and we will not send the webhook.

Since we notify you of verification via webhook, the flow is asynchronous and
out-of-band from the client application's perspective, which means that you will
need to notify the client of the verification status on your server's
initiative. You can do this in at least three ways:

1. Having the client poll an endpoint on your backend that checks the status of
   the verification session
2. Using a WebSocket connection to push the status to the client
3. Using a server-side event subscription to push the status to the client
4. In native mobile apps, using a push notification to push the status to the
   client
