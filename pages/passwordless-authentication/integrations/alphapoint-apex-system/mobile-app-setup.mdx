# Keyri QR Login for AlphaPoint APEX Mobile Apps

Mobile app integration for Keyri's QR login system is comprised of installing
the Keyri SDKs in the APEX-powered mobile apps as well as creating a
`getApiCredentials()` function for a specific APEX WebSocket API call, examples
of which are in the [iOS App Integration](./mobile/ios) and
[Android App Integration](./mobile/android) pages. The same can be done in apps
created with Flutter or React Native.

In summary:

1.  Create the `getApiCredentials()` function in your mobile app, which will
    return temporary API login credentials for your user

2.  Invoke the function whenever the user scans the QR code - either through
    your app's existing QR code scanner or through a deep link (Universal Link
    or App Link)

3.  Stringify and pass in the API credentials you receive from APEX into Keyri's
    `initiateQrSession()` method as the `payload`

The Keyri API includes adaptive UI elements for the confirmation screens, so you
don't have to do any design work for your mobile app if you wish not to.
