# Add QR Login to you AlphaPoint APEX-Powered Exchange System

As an AlphaPoint Gold Partner, Keyri has a first-class integration with the APEX
exchange system. The integration provides instantaneous, secure QR login on APEX
web interfaces through simple modifications to your web app and mobile app.

Keyri's QR login system allows users to sign into an APEX-powered web portal by
scanning a QR code located on the login page if they have the associated
APEX-powered mobile app installed. This system provides additional security in
the form of automatic biometric verification and makes login easier by removing
the need for the user to type in their email address, password, and 2FA code.

## Technical Overview

The technical principles behind Keyri's QR login implementation with the APEX
system are as follows.

1.  Once the user scans the login QR code, the mobile app asks the APEX
    WebSocket gateway to provision a temporary API key and API secret for the
    given UserId.

2.  These three items are then loaded into the Keyri SDK as the `payload`, which
    encrypts them and sends them to the Keyri Widget on the browser.&#x20;

3.  The browser Widget decrypts these items, and using a frontend script
    custom-made for APEX systems, generates a login signature and authenticates
    the user with APEX, receiving a SessionToken in return.

4.  The browser script de-provisions the temporary API credentials from the APEX
    system.

5.  The browser script uses the SessionToken to log the user in.

The entire system employs end-to-end encryption. All credentials transmitted
through it are encrypted from the mobile client and can only be decrypted by the
original browser client.
