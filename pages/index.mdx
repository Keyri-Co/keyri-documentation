# Introduction

Keyri brings together authentication and fraud protection workflows that offer a
frictionless and secure digital customer experience.

1. **Authentication**: Our
   [passwordless authentication](/passwordless-authentication) suite enables
   biometric + cryptographic key authentication on all platforms and devices,
   including web, providing a seamless user experience, strengthening
   multifactor account security, and reducing reliance on SMS one-time
   passcodes. Replace passwords in every user flow with
   [Email Magic Link](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/email-magic-link)
   and [Reverse SMS](/passwordless-authentication/echoguard/reverse-sms).

2. **Real-Time Fraud Prevention**: Our [fraud prevention](/fraud-prevention)
   platform offers a way to monitor user events such as signup and login across
   devices and provides risk signals to prevent fraud in real time. Keyri alerts
   you if suspicious activity is occurring, such as a user signing up with a
   device that has already created an account, logging in with a new device,
   trying to open or log into multiple accounts, or one user account is being
   accessed by multiple devices. The platform also provides a custom rules
   engine to manage policies and alerts.

3. **Mobile Application Security**: Our mobile SDKs improve the security of
   mobile applications by detecting jailbroken/rooted devices, swizzled,
   tampered, and malicious code during runtime. These
   [mobile security features](/mobile-sdks/mobile-app-security) empower
   developers to safeguard their applications against malicious attacks and
   reverse-engineering.

## Features

- Cryptographic [phishing-resistant MFA](/passwordless-authentication) on every
  device
- Easy and secure [QR login](/passwordless-authentication/qr-authentication) for
  web and smart TV apps
- High accuracy device fingerprinting and intelligence powering
  [real-time fraud prevention](/fraud-prevention)
- [Custom rules engine](/fraud-prevention/risk-rules/) for policy management
- Simple integration with most tech stacks and platforms
