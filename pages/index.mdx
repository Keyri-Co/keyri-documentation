# Introduction

Keyri brings together authentication and fraud protection workflows that offer a frictionless and secure digital customer experience.

Through a multi-layered security solution that gets to the device and application level, we are able to prevent fraud in real time while offering a seamless experience to customers.

1. **Authentication**: Our [passwordless authentication](/authentication/mobile-app-authentication) suite enables biometric + cryptographic key authentication on all platforms and devices, providing a seamless user experience, strengthening multifactor account security, and reducing reliance on SMS one-time passcodes.

2. **Real-Time Fraud Prevention**: Our [fraud prevention](/fraud-prevention) platform offers a way to monitor user authentication events across devices, sessions, and IP/location, and provides associated risk signals to prevent fraud in real time. Keyri alerts companies if potentially nefarious activity is occurring, such as a user signing up with a device that has already created an account, logging in with a new device, trying to open or log into multiple accounts, or one user account is being accessed by multiple devices.

3. **Mobile Application Security**: Our mobile SDKs improve the security of mobile applications by detecting jailbroken/rooted devices, swizzled, tampered, and malicious code during runtime. Additionally, we fully obfuscate our SDKs to prevent attackers from reverse engineering our methods. These [mobile security features](/mobile-security-features) empower developers to safeguard their applications against malicious attacks and practices.

**Highlights:**

- Cryptography-based phishing resistant MFA
- Passwordless authentication suite including QR code login/transaction verification
- High accuracy device fingerprinting and intelligence
- Real time fraud prevention
- Custom rules engine for policy management
- Proprietary session token lock and tracking to prevent malware based ATO attacks
- Developer ease of use and integration with existing IAM and tech stack.
