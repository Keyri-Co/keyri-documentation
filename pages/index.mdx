# About

We build utilities for user authentication and user device fingerprinting across mobile and web applications. Our mobile SDKs and web packages allow you to:

- Add truly secure ["sign in with QR" functionality](/authentication/qr-authentication) on your multi-platform application
- [Authenticate users in your mobile app](/authentication/mobile-app-authentication) with just biometrics - no passwords required
- Cryptographically associate users' phones with their accounts and automatically authenticate them in the background
- [Fingerprint](/device-fingerprinting) users' [mobile devices](/device-fingerprinting/mobile-fingerprinting) and [web browsers](/device-fingerprinting/web-fingerprinting) to detect and block malicious activity as well as improve user experience
