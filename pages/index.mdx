# Process Overview

The authentication process flow for Keyri can be summarized as follows:

## Existing User

Starting a secure login is simple: a QR code with the browser's public encryption key shows up on the user's browser. The user scans the QR code with their phone to get the key.

Next, the user is asked to log in and approve the request. In return, the phone signs a nonce with its private signature key. The nonce, signature, and public signature key, plus some other info, are encrypted using the browser's public encryption key.

The phone sends the encrypted data to the browser. Once the browser gets it, the data is decrypted and sent to your server. At the end, your server checks the signature and figures out who the user is based on the public key.
