# Keyri iOS SDK

## System Requirements

- iOS 14+
- Swift 5+
- Apple A7 chip or newer (The A7 shipped with the iPhone 5s)

## Integration

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate the Keyri iOS SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```ruby copy
pod 'keyri-pod'
```

The SDK can then be imported into any Swift file as follows:

```swift copy
import keyri-pod
```

### Option 1 - Universal Links

To handle Universal Links (e.g., for QR login straight from the user's built-in camera app), you need to add the Associated Domains Entitlement to your App.entitlements file. To set up the entitlement in your app, open the targetâ€™s Signing & Capabilities tab in Xcode and add the Associated Domains capability, or if you already have entitlements you can modify your App.entitlements file to match this example:

```xml copy
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
	<array>
		<string>applinks:{domainName}</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

This will handle all links with the following scheme: `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to?sessionId={sessionId}`

**Note:** Keyri will create your `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to` page automatically once you configure it in the [dashboard](https://app.keyri.com)

In the AppDelegate where the processing of links is declared, you need to add handlers in the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method:

<Tabs items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']}>
    <Tab>
```swift copy
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL
    else {
        return false
    }

    process(url: incomingURL)

    return true
}

func process(url: URL) {
    let sessionId = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)?.queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "sessionId" })?.value ?? ""
    let payload = "Custom payload here"
    let appKey = "App key here" // Get this value from the Keyri Developer Portal

    let keyri = KeyriInterface(appKey: appKey) // Be sure to import the SDK at the top of the file
    keyri.initiateQrSession(sessionId: sessionId, publicUserId: "TestUser") { sessionResult in
        switch sessionResult {
        case .success(let session):
            // You can optionally create a custom screen and pass the session ID there. We recommend this approach for large enterprises
            // In a real world example youâ€™d wait for user confirmation first
            do {
                try session.confirm(payload: payload, trustNewBrowser: true) // or session.deny()
            } catch {
                print(error)
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
        }
    }
}

```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```objective-c copy

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Note:** Keyri will set up the required `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` JSON at your `https://{yourSubdomain}.onekey.to` page as required by Apple to handle Universal Link handling. Details on this mechanism are described here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/supporting-associated-domains

### Option 2 - In-App Scanner

This can be used in conjunction with Universal links or exclusively.

The Keyri SDK includes a default Scanner view, which can be invoked and displayed as shown below. Unfortunately, due to platform limitations, we had to keep this in UIKit for the time being but will be on the lookout for options to convert over to SwiftUI as time goes on. The completion block is the important piece here: we return the exact string as shown in the QR code. All you need to do is convert to URL, and then you're free to process the response the same way we did above (notice the `process(url)` function is exactly the same in both cases)

```swift copy
func handleDisplayingScanner() {
    let scanner = Scanner()
    scanner.completion = { str in
        guard let url = URL(string: str) else { return nil }
        process(url)
    }

    scanner.show()
}

func process(url: URL) {
    let sessionId = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)?.queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "sessionId" })?.value ?? ""
    let payload = "Custom payload here"
    let appKey = "App key here" // Get this value from the Keyri Developer Portal

    let keyri = KeyriInterface(appKey: appKey) // Be sure to import the SDK at the top of the file
    keyri.initiateQrSession(sessionId: sessionId, publicUserId: "TestUser") { sessionResult in
        switch sessionResult {
        case .success(let session):
            // You can optionally create a custom screen and pass the session ID there. We recommend this approach for large enterprises
            // In a real world example youâ€™d wait for user confirmation first
            do {
                try session.confirm(payload: payload, trustNewBrowser: true) // or session.deny()
            } catch {
                print(error)
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
        }
    }
}

```

## Interacting with the API

The following methods are available to interact with the Keyri SDK API, which can be used to craft your own custom flows and leverage the SDK in different ways:
- `public init(appKey: String, publicApiKey: String? = nil, serviceEncryptionKey: String? = nil, blockEmulatorDetection: Bool? = true)`- Initialize the Keyri object with the keys retrieved from the dashboard. If you're using sendEvent() to take advantage of our fraud dashboard, the publicApiKey and serviceEncryptionKey are required

- `func sendEvent(publicUserId: String = Constants.ANON_USER, eventType: EventType = .visits, success: Bool = true, completion: @escaping (Result<FingerprintResponse, Error>) -> ())` - Sends an event to our dashboard containing a device snapshot to our dashboard. The response you receive will be sent, as is, to your own backend, where you can utilize our scripts to help you decrypt. See the code sample below and https://docs.keyri.com/fraud-prevention for more

- `func KeyriInterface.easyKeyriAuth(payload: String, publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> ())` - call to have Keyri drive you through the entire process - we display the scanner, scan the QR code, handle user confirmation and fire off the result to the browser - all with one line of code in your app ðŸ˜€

- `func KeyriInterface.initiateQrSession(sessionId: String, publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<Session, Error>) -> Void)` - call after obtaining the sessionId from QR-code or deep link. Returns Session object with Risk attributes (needed to show confirmation screen) or Exception

- `func KeyriInterface.initializeDefaultConfirmationScreen(session: Session, payload: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> ())` - to show Confirmation with default UI. Alternatively, you can implement a custom Confirmation Screen. The Default screen is built using SwiftUI, however the session object is designed to work seamlessly with UIKit as well should you prefer that route

- `func KeyriInterface.login(publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<LoginObject, Error>) -> ())` - call this method to generate object for login which includes timestampNonce, signature, publicKey and userId

- `func KeyriInterface.register(publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<RegisterObject, Error>) -> ())` - call this method to generate object for register which includes publicKey and userId

- `func KeyriInterface.processLink(url: URL, payload: String, publicUserId: String?, completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> ())` - process flow with passed uri with showing default confirmation screen. Easiest way to process session from deeplink. Returns result of authentication or error

- `func Session.confirm(payload: String, trustNewBrowser: Bool = false, completion: @escaping (Error?) -> ())` - call this function if user confirms the dialog. Returns authentication result or error

- `func Session.deny(payload: String, completion: @escaping (Error?) -> ())` - call if the user denies the dialog. Returns denial result or error

- `func KeyriInterface.generateAssociationKey(publicUserId: String = Constants.ANON_USER, completion: @escaping (Result<P256.Signing.PublicKey, Error>) -> ())` - creates a persistent ECDSA keypair for the given public user ID (example: email address) and return public key

- `func KeyriInterface.generateUserSignature(publicUserId: String = Constants.ANON_USER, data: Data, completion: @escaping (Result<P256.Signing.ECDSASignature, Error>) -> ())` - returns an ECDSA signature of the timestamp and optional customSignedData with the publicUserId's privateKey (or, if not provided, anonymous privateKey), data can be anything

- `func KeyriInterface.getAssociationKey(publicUserId: String = Constants.ANON_USER, completion: @escaping (Result<P256.Signing.PublicKey?, Error>) -> ())` - returns Base64 public key for the specified publicUserId

- `func KeyriInterface.removeAssociationKey(publicUserId: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> ())` - removes association public key for the specified publicUserId

- `func KeyriInterface.listAssociactionKeys(completion: @escaping (Result<[String:String]?, Error>) -> ())` - returns a dictionary of "association keys" and ECDSA Base64 public keys

- `func KeyriInterface.listUniqueAccounts(completion: @escaping (Result<[String:String]?, Error>) -> ())` - returns a dictionary of unique "association keys" and ECDSA Base64 public keys

- `func KeyriInterface.sendEvent(publicUserId: String = Constants.ANON_USER, eventType: EventType = .visits, success: Bool = true, completion: @escaping (Result<FingerprintResponse, Error>) -> ())` - sends fingerprint event and event result for specified publicUserId's

`payload` can be anything (session token or a stringified JSON containing multiple items. Can include things like publicUserId, timestamp, customSignedData and ECDSA signature)

// TODO: Add Swift/Obj-C references as on Android

### Session Object

The session object is returned on successful initiateQrSession calls, and is used to handle presenting the situation to the end user and getting their confirmation to complete authentication. Below are some of the key properties and methods that can be triggered. If you are utilizing the built-in views, you are only responsible for calling the confirm/deny methods above

- IPAddressMobile/Widget - the IP Address of both mobile device and web browser&#x20;

- WidgetUserAgent - the browser user-agent (e.g., Chrome on macOS)&#x20;

- RiskAnalytics - if available on your subscription plan

- RiskStatus - clear, warn or deny

- RiskFlagString - if RiskStatus is warn or deny, this string alerts the user to what is triggering the risk situation

- GeoData - Location data for both mobile and widget

- Mobile
- city

- country_code

- Browser

- city

- country_code

- `Session.confirm()` and `Session.deny()` - see descriptions in **Interacting with the API**

# Disclaimer

We care deeply about the quality of our product and rigorously test every piece of functionality we offer. That said, every integration is different. Every app on the App Store has a different permutation of build settings, compiler flags, processor requirements, compatibility issues etc and it's impossible for us to cover all of those bases, so we strongly recommend thorough testing of your integration before shipping to production.
