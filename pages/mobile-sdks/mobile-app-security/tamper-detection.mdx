# Tamper Detection Configuration

Keyri's tamper detection feature allows you to detect if your mobile app assets
and/or logic have been tampered with. It is based on checksum comparisons. You
first submit your app bundles' checkums to Keyri, and the SDK will compare them
with the current state of the app at runtime. If a mismatch is detected, the SDK
will terminate the app.

Note that this feature is entirely optional and disabled by default. It is
enabled when you submit your app's checksums to Keyri. Runtime checks are
performed by the SDK at initialization automatically.
