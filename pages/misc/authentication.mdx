## Keyri: Passwordless and QR Authentication for Mobile Apps

Keyri provides secure passwordless authentication for mobile apps using cryptographic credentials and biometrics, as well as QR-based authentication for web apps. With Keyri, users can seamlessly authenticate without passwords or OTPs, and developers can easily integrate secure authentication into their applications.

### Mobile App Authentication

Keyri's mobile SDKs enable true passwordless authentication using cryptographic signatures and device-specific key pairs. Combined with biometrics, this method creates a strong multi-factor authentication solution.

### QR Authentication

Keyri's QR authentication enables users to log into web apps by scanning a QR code and confirming the login in the mobile app. This secure and convenient multi-factor authentication method can be used for various high-risk events in your application.

### End-to-End Encryption for QR-Based Communications

Keyri employs end-to-end encryption to send data between your mobile app and web client securely. Sensitive data is transmitted through the Keyri API fully encrypted, ensuring the privacy and security of user information.

### Smart Deep Linking

Keyri's QR codes enable smart deep linking, allowing users to scan QR codes and intelligently route them to your app or to your App Store/Play Store listing if the app is not installed.

### Authentication Risk Analytics

Keyri's Scaling and Enterprise plans offer IP-based risk analytics to protect users from phishing attacks. The system incorporates various signals, including distance, country differential, TOR IP usage, known attacker IPs, and anonymous proxies to analyze and block potential threats.
