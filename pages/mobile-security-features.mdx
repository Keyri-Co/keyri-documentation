# Mobile Security

Keyri has been designed with a multi layered security approach in mind. Our SDKs are embedded with a suite of security checks as outlined below. These are best in class standalone features that can be utilized when Keyri methods are called or be implemented throughout your mobile application for protection against code tampering and manipulation.

## Features

The SDK can be utilized for

- Emulator detection
- Jailbreak detection
- Method swizzle detection
- Presence of known malicious apps and packages on the device
- Code tamper detection
- Runtime injection detction
- [Coming soon] Obfucscation and hardening

## Integration

See [mobile SDK documentation](/mobile-sdks) for detailed instructions on how to integrate our SDKs into your application

## Usage

- Keyri automatically runs our security checks upon the instantiation of the Keyri object built into our SDKs. So simply calling the Keyri Constructor will trigger each check. The SDK is configured to terminate the application if any of these checks fail, as the entire runtime environment and all of the data within your application are compromised in this situation.
